The statement "It can only be used to access class members which are private and not protected" is not applicable to a friend function.

Here's why:
A friend function can access both private and protected members of a class, not just private members. The purpose of a friend function is to allow an external function (or another class) to have access to the private and protected members of a class, bypassing the usual access control.
Explanation of other options:

Explanation of other options:
"It allows a function declared outside a class to access the private and protected members of that class": This is true. Friend functions provide external access to a class’s private and protected members.

"The 'friend' keyword is used with the function inside the class": This is also true. The friend keyword is declared inside the class to make the external function a friend of the class, even though the function itself is defined outside the class.

"Friend function is the reason C++ is not known as a pure object-oriented language": This is true in a sense, as the use of friend functions allows breaking the strict encapsulation principle of object-oriented programming. It allows external functions to access private data, which is typically not allowed in pure OOP.

Thus, the correct answer is: "It can only be used to access class members which are private and not protected."0 . Which of these is not applicable to the friend function?
